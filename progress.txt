# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

### US-001: aapt2 Auto-Detection
**Completed:** ✅
**Commit:** cea57bc4149d

**Pattern:** Tool detection with graceful fallback chain
1. Check system PATH first (`command -v aapt2`)
2. Verify executable (`-x` test)
3. Fall back to architecture-specific bundled binary
4. Special handling for architectures without bundled binaries (x86_64)
5. Provide clear warnings with actionable guidance
6. Allow graceful degradation (empty AAPT2 variable disables optimization)

**Key Insight:** Using `command -v` with `|| true` prevents errexit failure, allowing clean fallback logic. Always log the decision path for debugging.

**Testing Note:** Should test on: arm64 (with/without system aapt2), x86_64 (with/without system aapt2), with missing bundled binaries.

### US-002: Remove Temporary and Build Artifacts
**Completed:** ✅
**Status:** Already clean

**Findings:**
- temp/ and build/ directories don't currently exist (created during builds)
- Both directories properly listed in .gitignore (lines 6-7)
- No temporary files (*.tmp, *.cache, *.bak, *~) found in repository
- No cache directories (__pycache__, .cache, etc.) present
- Git status clean - no temporary files committed

**Pattern:** Repository hygiene verification
1. Check if target directories exist
2. Verify .gitignore coverage
3. Search for common temporary file patterns
4. Scan for cache directories
5. Confirm git status is clean

**Key Insight:** Preventative .gitignore entries are sufficient. Temporary directories created at runtime are automatically excluded.

### US-003: Remove Unused Scripts and Configurations
**Completed:** ✅
**Commit:** 7b6354ad887b

**Audit Results:**
- Removed: test_checks.sh (development test, not referenced)
- Kept all scripts in scripts/ (all documented and intentional):
  - aapt2-optimize.sh: Build pipeline integration (scripts/README.md)
  - changelog-generator.sh: Release automation (FEATURES.md)
  - dependency-checker.sh: CI workflow (dependency-check.yml)
  - generate_matrix.sh: CI workflow (build.yml)
  - optimize-assets.sh: Manual utility (scripts/README.md)
  - release-manager.sh: Release automation (WORKFLOWS.md)
  - unused-strings.sh: Manual utility (scripts/README.md)
- All test configs in tests/ are actively used

**Pattern:** Script audit methodology
1. List all scripts in root and scripts/
2. Check references in build.sh, utils.sh, extras.sh
3. Scan CI workflows for usage (.github/workflows/)
4. Verify documentation coverage (docs/, scripts/README.md)
5. Remove only truly orphaned files

**Key Insight:** Documentation coverage is a strong signal. If a script is documented, it's intentional even if not in CI. Development test scripts without documentation or references are safe to remove.

### US-004: Clean Up Deprecated Documentation
**Completed:** ✅
**Commits:** 73746f1fb4de, 6721bdb2a360

**Removed:**
- docs/sessions/20260113-051922-session.md: Temporary session log
- plans/cleanup_and_maintenance.md: Superseded by PRD.md and conductor tracks
- Added /docs/sessions and /plans to .gitignore

**Kept:**
- README.md and docs/README.md serve different purposes (not duplicates)
- docs/FEATURES.md: Current feature documentation
- docs/config-generator/: Active web tool
- All conductor/ docs: Active planning system
- All .github/ docs: CI/CD documentation

**Pattern:** Documentation audit methodology
1. List all documentation files recursively
2. Identify temporary/session files (timestamps, "session" in name)
3. Check for superseded planning documents (compare with current PRD/tracks)
4. Verify no duplicate content between files
5. Add common temporary patterns to .gitignore

**Key Insight:** Session logs and superseded planning documents accumulate over time. Proactively add their directories to .gitignore after removal. Distinguish between different-purpose READMEs (project vs directory index).

## Phase 3 Complete! ✅

All Phase 3 user stories (US-001 to US-004) implemented and committed.

**Summary:**
- US-001: Smart aapt2 auto-detection
- US-002: Repository already clean
- US-003: Removed unused test script
- US-004: Cleaned deprecated docs

**Next:** Phase 4 - Python Migration & Script Consolidation
